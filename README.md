# Neighborhood Map Project

This is the final project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree course.

## Overview
This project uses the Google Maps API and Foursquare API to list restaurants in the Flushing area of New York. The app allows you to search for a restaurant on that list. Clicking on a restaurant will show the address of the location on the map.

## Installation
1. Clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/chanelaine/neighborhoods-map`
2. Navigate to the project folder and install all project dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`

The page will open on http://localhost:3000/.

**Note**: The default service worker from the create-react-app is only available when running a production build. To do so, use `npm run build`
