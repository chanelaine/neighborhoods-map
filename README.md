#Neighborhood Map Project

This is the final project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree course. This uses the Google Maps API and Foursquare API to list restaurants in the Flushing area of New York. The app allows you to search for a restaurant on the list. Clicking on a restaurant will show the address of the location on the map.

## Installation
1. Clone the project
2. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`

The page will open on http://localhost:3000/.
